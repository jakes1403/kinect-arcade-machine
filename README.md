# McNeese ACM Kinect Arcade Machine Project
This is a repo containing the documentation and source code for the McNeese ACM Kinect Arcade machine project.

## Project info
The intended outcome of this project is to have:
 * A custom-created game, made with the open source Godot Engine, that is fun to play, looks graphically appealing, and draws an audience.
 * A custom module for the Godot game engine to support the Kinect, and potentially add general computer vision capabilities to the open source engine.
 * An arcade machine cabinet, to house the machine hardware and make the game look appealing to potential players.
